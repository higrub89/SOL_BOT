## 🛡️ Jito Bundling: The Sovereign Shield
In the high-stakes arena of Solana, public transactions are a liability. **The Chassis** employs **Jito Bundles** to wrap your execution in a layer of absolute privacy.

- **Atomic Integrity**: All operations—swap and validator gratuity—are executed as a single, indivisible event. Pure binary success or no execution at all.
- **Dark Pool Execution**: Your trades bypass the public mempool, rendering them invisible to front-running bots and predatory sandwich attacks.
- **The Omnipresent Panic (`/panic_all`)**: In moments of market turbulence, the system orchestrates a multi-transaction bundle, liquidating your entire portfolio at once. It is the tactical equivalent of an emergency extraction—seamless, rapid, and total.

## 💰 The Dual-Stage Liquidation Protocol
Maximizing yield is a science of balance. The Chassis handles the complexity of partial exits so you can focus on strategy.

| Tier | Objective | Dynamics |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Stage Alpha (TP1)** | Principal Extraction | Automatically liquidates 50% at +100%. Your initial capital is returned to the vault. |
| **Stage Omega (TP2)** | Infinite Upside | The "Moonbag" protocol. The remainder runs to hunt for exponential targets while the system maintains watch. |

*Dynamic recalibration available via `/update <MINT> tp=X` in mid-flight.*

## 📊 Real-Time Institutional Ledger (`/positions`)
The distance between perception and reality is where money is lost. **The Chassis** closes that gap with a high-fidelity lookup system.

- **Fidelity Monitoring**: No more manual spreadsheets. Real-time PnL is calculated from the precise millisecond of entry.
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Monitor Entry/Exit prices, active Drawdown levels, and precise SOL yields directly through the encrypted telemetry stream.

---

## ⚙️ Dynamic Configuration: The Hot-Swap Engine
Institutional environments require adaptability without downtime. Our `settings.json` architecture allows for "hot-loading" critical parameters.

- **Execution Arming**: Toggle between `watch-only` and `active-execution` without a system reboot.
- **Gas Mastery**: Adjust `jito_tip_lamports` dynamically to match network congestion.
- **Heartbeat Control**: Tune the heartbeat (`monitor_interval_sec`) to optimize between speed and API efficiency.

---

## 🏥 Tactical Diagnostics (`/ping`)
Maintain operational readiness with our comprehensive health-check protocol.

- **RPC Telemetry**: Real-time latency tracking of Helius nodes.
- **Structural Integrity**: Continuous monitoring of wallet balances and engine arming status.
- **Persistent Logs**: Every execution is recorded in the sovereign ledger for future audit.
